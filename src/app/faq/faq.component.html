          Absolutely! If you won’t be at home during the scheduled housekeeping services, you can either leave a key in
          a safe location or give a key to your Fresharoo. We understand that trust is an essential factor when it comes
          to granting access to your home, so you can have confidence in our team of professional and reliable
          Fresharoos at any time.
          However, we recommend that you only provide a key for regular cleaning services. For one-off or occasional
          cleanings, it’s best to be present during the cleaning service, as we want to ensure that you are completely
          satisfied with the service provided.

          To ensure that we can reserve a Fresharoo for your scheduled cleaning service, we kindly ask that payment be

          Ideally, it is recommended to make payment prior to the scheduled day of your regular cleaning service.
          However, if that’s not possible, you can always make the payment on the day of the service. It’s always a good
          idea to confirm the payment arrangement with the Fresharoo beforehand to ensure a smooth and hassle-free
          transaction.

            No, it’s completely up to you whether or not you are present during the regular or casual cleaning service.
            If you are unable to meet your Fresharoo in person, you can simply leave a note indicating the location of
            the cleaning equipment and products.
